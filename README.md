# Black Belt Exam Training

I developed the BBET to help me train for the judo black belt graduation exam.
This application show randomly selects some techniques for each of the categories of judo techniques so that they performed simulating what the day the exam would be like.

## Groups and Techniques

Each technique belongs to a majors groups subvidided into smaller groups. Eg.:

**Nage-waza** (throwing techniques, 投げ技)
- Te-waza (arm techniques, 手技)
- Koshi-waza (hip techniques, 腰技)
- Ashi-waza (leg techniques, 足技)
- Mae-sutemi-waza (forward sacrifice techniques)
- Yoko-sutemi-waza (sacrificing techniques to the side, 橫捨身技)
    
**Katame-waza** (ground techniques)
- Osaekomi-waza or osae-waza (immobilization techniques, 押込技)
